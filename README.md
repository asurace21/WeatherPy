# WeatherPy

## Purpose 
The objective of this challenge is to enhance the PlanMyTrip app in order to make it more user friendly. For example, we will be including the weather descriptions for select vacation destinations. Once users input their weather preferences, we can use that information to identify potential travel destinations and hotels. The user will then select four cities from which to create a travel itinerary. We will then use the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities and a display it on a user-friendly marker layer map
